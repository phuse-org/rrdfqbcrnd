# SPARQL scripts for the demographics cube (DC-DEMO-sample.ttl)

The examples below uses `arq` from Apache Jena
(http://jena.apache.org). To install arq - download and unpack the
latest version of apache-jena from
(http://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi).
Then you need some way
of invoking `arq`; I use a not-so-clever-approach: `cd ~/bin; ln -s
/opt/apache-jena-2.13.0/bin/arq`.

Given a SPARQL query and RDF data, `arq` returns the result of the
query. So this is the command line way of making a SPARQL query.

The use of arq is described in many places, see for example
(http://www.learningsparql.com/).

All `arq` commands below are to be run in the directory with the
sample files, which is `inst/extdata/CUBE-standards-rdf` directory or
`extdata/CUBE-standards-rdf` depending on the whether the development version
or the installed version of the package is used.

The cd below in each code block is included because I could not find a
quick way to get the code chunk executed in that directory. knitr is
flexible enough to do it, I have not yet found the right way to do it.
So, ignore the repeated cd ..

For making the SPARQL queries I used a simple trick - copy the turtle
definition from the cube.ttl, and do a replace regexp in emacs using
pattern `+\([^:]+\):\([^ ]+\) .*$` and replacement ` \1:\2 ?\2 ;`.

## Get all member of qb:ComponentProperty 
```{r, engine='bash'}
cd ../extdata/sample-rdf
arq --results ttl --data ../../../../rrdfqb/inst/extdata/cube-vocabulary-rdf/cube.ttl --query qb-construct-ComponentProperty.rq > fordot.ttl
rapper -i turtle -o dot fordot.ttl > fordot.dot
dot -x -Tpng -ograph.png fordot.dot
rm -f fordot.dot
```

ToDo(MJA): location for cube.ttl should be generated by the program - not using a directory reference


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../extdata/sample-rdf/graph.png")
```

The file is needed for rendering, so no clean up.
```{r, engine='bash',eval=FALSE}
cd ../extdata/sample-rdf
rm -f graph.png
```
